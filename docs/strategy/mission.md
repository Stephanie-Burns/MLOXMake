### **MLOXMaker: A Tool for Modders, Built for Learning & Collaboration**

MLOXMaker is more than just a **mlox rule visualization and automation tool**—it’s an opportunity to **learn, teach, and contribute**. The goal is not just to make rule creation easier, but also to **improve modding workflows**, foster **community-driven rule management**, and provide **a clear, structured approach** to handling mod dependencies and conflicts.

### **🔹 Why This Matters**
- 🛠 **Making mlox more accessible** → Many modders don’t fully understand mlox rules. MLOXMaker aims to bridge that gap by providing an **intuitive rule editor** and **visualization tools**.
- 🔄 **Automating tedious rule management** → Instead of manually writing `[Order]`, `[Conflict]`, or `[Requires]` rules, modders can **generate them dynamically** based on dependencies and conflicts.
- 🔍 **Visualizing mod relationships** → Seeing **how mods interact** through dependency graphs helps modders **understand load order issues more clearly**.
- 📦 **Future-proofing mod rules** → With structured export formats (`mlox_user.txt`, JSON), MLOXMaker helps ensure **rules remain organized and reusable**.

---

### **🔹 Open Source & Community Involvement**
MLOXMaker will be **open-source**, designed for **modders, maintainers, and developers** who want to improve modding tools.

✅ **Developer-Friendly Documentation** →  
- A **clear architecture breakdown** so contributors can jump in quickly.  
- **API documentation & code comments** for easier debugging.  
- A **developer mode** in the app for real-time debugging and visualization.  

✅ **Teaching by Example** →  
- The **GitHub repo will include guides** on designing GUI applications with PySide6.  
- The development process itself will be **documented**, so others can learn from our approach.  
- Built-in debugging tools like **graph-based rule visualization** will make understanding load orders easier.  

✅ **Encouraging Contributions** →  
- Easy-to-understand **issue tracking & roadmap** for new contributors.  
- A **flexible architecture** that allows future integrations (e.g., web-based expansion).  
- **Community-driven rule sharing** as a potential future feature.

### **🔹 Learning & Documenting the Journey**
Since **Stephanie is also learning through this process**, MLOXMaker will include **a development log** to capture key lessons along the way.

💡 **Topics to document:**  
- Mistakes & what we learned from them.  
- Why we chose **certain patterns over others**.  
- How to structure **reusable PySide6 components**.  
- **How to design MVC-based modding tools.**  
- The challenges of **automating rule generation for mlox**.  

---

### **🔹 Built-In Developer & Debugging Features**
To make it **easier to work with, extend, and learn from MLOXMaker**, the app will have:

🔍 **Dependency Graphs** → See how mods **connect** at a glance.  
📜 **Event Log (Blotter View)** → Tracks **all app activity & state changes** for debugging.  
📖 **Live Rule Preview** → Real-time visualization of how rules will appear in mlox.  
🖼 **Interactive UI Elements** → Drag & drop mods, auto-suggest rules, and more.  

---

### **Summary: MLOXMaker as a Learning Tool**
MLOXMaker isn’t just about **making modding easier**—it’s about **building a project that benefits modders, developers, and the community**.

🚀 **Open Source** → Fully available for collaboration & contributions.  
📖 **Developer-Friendly** → Built-in debugging, API docs, and architecture clarity.  
🛠 **Educational** → Guides on **PySide6, MVC, automation, and mod dependency handling**.  
🔎 **Extensible** → Encouraging **modders & devs to add their own features** easily.
